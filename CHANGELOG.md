# Change Log

Notable changes to `@qodalis/cli-server-dashboard`, the admin dashboard of the Qodalis CLI servers.

## 1.0.0-beta.11

### Your own name and icon

- The dashboard shows the Qodalis Solutions logo by default (browser tab, sidebar, sign-in page), instead of a "Q"
  letter.
- Servers set the dashboard's name and icon, and its terminal's name, with the admin plugin's branding
  (`Branding` in .NET, `setBranding()` in Node, `set_branding()` in Python). It reaches the dashboard as `branding`
  in `theme.json`; malformed values are dropped, and the Qodalis logo is shown when a custom icon fails to load.
  See [Name and icon](README.md#name-and-icon).

### Terminal

- The terminal's user is the dashboard's signed-in user (prompt, `whoami`, `id`, `perms`) when the server has the
  users plugin: it loads `@qodalis/cli-users` in embedded mode with the dashboard's token, and `logout` signs out of
  the dashboard. Servers signed in with the static admin password keep the terminal as before.

### Jobs

- The jobs list and detail show only the actions a job offers (`actions`, for servers whose jobs run elsewhere, such
  as a .NET `ICliJobManager`); job ids are encoded in the API paths (ids such as `fetch-rates:bnr`).
